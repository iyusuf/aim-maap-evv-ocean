Here we go — first draft of **your** ACTOR block for AIM → MAAP → EVV.

You can copy-paste this as a reusable snippet in any prompt.

## 🧩 ACTOR: IQBAL YUSUF (AIM-MAAP-EVV TAG)

**Name / Handle**

* Iqbal Yusuf
* Also known as: *CAIO @ KSE*, *applied AI architect*, *ChatGPT mama’s human*

**Primary Roles**

* Chief AI Officer (CAIO) at KS Engineers, P.C.
* Hands-on Applied AI & Software Architect (Java, Spring Boot, Python)
* Platform & DevOps learner (Kubernetes, GitOps, IaC, RAG, Agents, MCP)
* Teacher / explainer for juniors and non-technical stakeholders

**Core Domains**

* Applied AI in AEC (engineering consulting, civil, GIS, enterprise workflows)
* Bank Payment Gateways, business process automation, IAM (Keycloak etc.)
* On-prem & hybrid AI stacks (local LLMs, RAG over files, internal tools)
* CAIO-OS: dashboards, KPIs, automation %, ROI hours/week

**Superpowers**

* Connects business pain → architecture → implementation quickly
* Thinks in frameworks: AIM → MAAP → EVV, 3-layer SDLC (Data → Insight → UI)
* Comfortable with complex systems: CI/CD, GitOps, microservices, RAG pipelines
* Loves structured artifacts: checklists, templates, dashboards, README/whitepapers

**Current Season / Focus**

* Closing skill gaps in: function calls, tools, RAG, agents, MCP
* Building local RAG + agentic stacks on Windows laptop for real KSE use cases
* Turning experiments into **reusable patterns** (Spec-Kit, CAIO-OS, playbooks)
* Practicing deterministic + policy-based prompting as a daily discipline

**Working Style**

* Prefers: concrete examples, code (Python/Java), diagrams, and templates
* Likes: step-by-step plans, crash-courses (4–5 hrs), realistic “hello-world” projects
* Hates: vague hand-wavy theory, over-engineered fluff, “magic” with no levers
* Wants: every session to produce *an artifact* (script, doc, canvas, or diagram)

**Constraints / Preferences**

* Time-boxed learning (e.g., 30–60 mins, or 4–5 hr sprints)
* Uses Windows + WSL/Ubuntu, local LLMs (Ollama, etc.) and OpenAI API
* Avoids front-end heavy complexity unless truly justified (prefers server-rendered)
* Strong bias toward: on-prem / hybrid, low cost, measurable ROI, small but real wins

**North Star**

* Become a **hands-on CAIO** who can:

  * Design architectures,
  * Build working prototypes,
  * Explain them clearly to executives and engineers,
  * And show **weekly, visible ROI** (time saved, automation %, adoption).

## 🔖 Prompt-ready “Actor” snippet (short version)

Use this small block whenever you need to drop “yourself” into an AIM-MAAP-EVV prompt:

```text
ACTOR (HUMAN):
- Name: Iqbal Yusuf (CAIO @ KS Engineers)
- Role: Hands-on Applied AI architect & CAIO, focused on real-world automation in AEC.
- Context: Building local/hybrid AI systems (RAG, agents, MCP) with tight timeboxes and real ROI.
- Strengths: Java/Spring Boot, Python, DevOps basics, domain-driven thinking, templates, dashboards.
- Preferences: Concrete examples, code-first learning, server-rendered UIs, on-prem/hybrid over pure SaaS.
- Goal this session: Close a specific skill gap and produce at least one tangible artifact (script, doc, or diagram).
```
